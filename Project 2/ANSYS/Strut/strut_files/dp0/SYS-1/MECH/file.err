 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.453   TIME= 20:03:46
 Material number 4 (used by element 30848) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.188   TIME= 20:03:48
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 4 (used by element 30848) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.391   TIME= 20:03:51
 A linear perturbation analysis with contact usually requires turning on 
 large deflection option (NLGEOM,ON) in the base analysis.  Otherwise    
 the down-stream analysis will not use the current deformation           
 configuration which might lead to inaccurate solution or even memory    
 error.
